## About

This repository is a public ticketing system used by [FOSS@MAGIC](http://foss.rit.edu).
It is used both by students and RIT MAGIC faculty and staff.
Its purpose is to track progress of on-going and upcoming tasks and help prioritize focus.
Tasks are created as **issues** in the GitHub interface.
The [project board](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/tasks/projects/) uses kanban to organize and track progress.
